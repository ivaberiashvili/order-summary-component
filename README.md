## My process

My process improved drastically with this project. It took me almost 3 times less than my previous and less complex project.
I believe it came down to systematic approach that saved me lots of time.
- I started bringing in the main elements, images and text.
- then I created the shapes and defined the correct spacing using margin and padding and positioned elements with flexbox
- finally adding button functionality 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- I learned **background-image** property which I'm sure will be my go-to solution for the next projects.

### Continued development

My [next project](https://github.com/ivaberiashvili/skilled-elearning-landing-page) will be much more complex, which will allow me to test my flexbox knowledge and elements' hierarchy.


### Useful resources

- [Mdn Web Docs > CSS ](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/) - This is extremely helpful with real time examples.
